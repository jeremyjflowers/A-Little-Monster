## II. Story Line
	-	You awake from your slumber and notice that you are in . . . a box room? A cage? You do not know for it is too dark to notice. You here voices in your head, no not your own but others. As you explore the abandounded place your in, you find peices of you past. You discover that what ever you did landed you there. 

## II. Soon to Come
